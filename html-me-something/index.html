            This month, July 2021, I visited Austin on two separate occasions for my tattoo appointments. The title of this webpage is intentionally misleading, because while I have pictures of the delicous food I ate in Austin, I am instead going to write about the weird men I have encountered during my trips.

            My first trip to Austin was from July 2nd to July 5th for the first session of my sleeve tattoo. On that Saturday evening, after my eight-hour session, I took an Uber to a dive bar on West 6th Street and read a book (lame, I know). I sat there for a few hours and chatted with the bartender occasionally, then decided to take an Uber back home.

            While I was waiting on the curb for my Uber home, a chubby, non-threatening man of what looked like Indian descent approached me and initiated small talk. He asked if I was here in Austin by myself, to which I replied yes. He said he was also in town by himself, and asked me out for drinks and a meal some time. He seemed harmless enough so I gave him my phone number upon request. I told him that I was waiting for my ride home that night though, and that maybe we could meet the next day. He left, but throughout the night he sent me texts like "nice meeting you" and "good night :)" which I thought were kind of weird.

        <p>
            After the Indian guy left, not three minutes later, another man approached me while I was waiting for the same Uber home. This was a black man of a much larger stature and body weight. He seemed more forward than the previous lad, asking me what I was doing by myself and proclaiming that I should be living it up in Austin for Independence Day weekend, not going home early. In my mild inebriation, he convinced me to cancel my Uber and grab drinks with him, saying that he would pay for me and protect me from the creepers. I acquiesed.

            The man took me to a bar right across the street. This bar was much louder; it had a large, outdoor patio and a dancefloor inside. This was not my type of scene. Like I said, I was reading a book by myself at the previous dive bar. The man bought me a drink (I chose a vodka soda with a splash of cranberry) and we talked. And by "we talked", I meant that he talked my ear off. His intentions soon became very clear. Half an hour after I had just met this man, he was telling me things like he had always been looking for a woman like me; that Filipino women are the most gorgeous women on the planet; that he would drive to San Angelo, TX to visit me on the weekends; that I should consider working in real estate (still confused about that); and talked about relationships and marraige. I politely nodded along, but needless to say, I was very, very uncomfortable.

            Soon after that, we left the bar. We walked to a food truck and he bought me tacos. Then, we walked over to his car. His car was parked away a few streets over away from the crowd. I felt even more uncomfortable, but I could not think of an out. I got into his car at least knowing that I could fight him off if I needed to. He drove us over to Rainey Street. The entire ride there, he continued on about relationships and me being the perfect woman and I did my best to hide my grimaces of extreme discomfort from him.

            He finally found a spot and parked the car. Before we got out, he took out a handle of vodka from his center console and offered me a shot. I declined. He took a shot and gave a toast, but to what I do not remember. We finally got out of the car and walked towards Rainey Street. Suddenly, he mentioned that he he forgotten his water in the car, so he told me to "stay right where I was" and walked back to his car. I looked back. I felt like I needed to go. Now. So I took off running in the opposite direction, towards the crowd. People were moving out of my way giving me weird looks. A car honked at me (probably thinking I would run into the street to kill myself). I disappeared into the nightlife bustle of Rainey Street, trying to hide from that man. I was terrified. It must have looked like a human-trafficking incident.

            When I got to a place that was crowded enough and far enough away from him, I called another Uber home. This one was twice as expensive. I was shaken and fairly drunk. I did not have a good time that night. I got free tacos at least (not pictured here), but at what expense?
